## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) - Handling authentication
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database

### What I learned

An interesting project all together, this was my first time using Prisma orm and also postgresql, I definitely learn a lot about sql databases and how the function. This was also my first time trying the app directory in the latest Nextjs13, other than the aforementioned technologies I guess I'll also add the use of Reacts drag and drop API was quite interesting, not to forget I also used Open AI's text generation too to automate a little feature in this project.

### Continued development

In the future I hope to continue learning and working a lot with sql databases.

### Useful resources

- [NextJs 13 docs](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) - This helped me a lot when working with NextJs new app dir.
